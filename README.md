# TMDb-movie-dataset-analysis

What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

This analysis is a report that aims to answer these questions based on TMDb movie data .The data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

The report begins by raising some questions based on the dataset. The data is then cleaned and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to find out if there are any patterns in the data. A conclusion is then drawn to illustrate the insights found

The tools used in this report are Python libraries - `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. The Jupyter notebook is used to illustrate the interactive analysis.
